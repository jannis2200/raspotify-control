# Raspotify Control
Welcome to my Repository for Raspotify Control.

# What's Raspotify Control?
Raspotify Control is a simple application for controlling Raspotify. This means controlling the system audio level, showing latest logs and amixer status. You can also easily restart the entire RaspberryPi!

# What's Raspotify Control built with?
For programming Raspotify Control I used PHP, HTML and the default shell commands. Additional I used Bootstrap for the layout.
The whole Raspotify Control consists of two files.

index.php | showing main-page viewing the raspotify-status, amixer-status and buttons for several actions
command.php | Executing Commands and showing feedback.

# What's going to be added in the future?
In the future I will add a login-system based on a config-file, later using MySQL - but you will be able to choose.
Additional, I will integrate the Spotify-API in order to skip tracks, play and pause music etc.
